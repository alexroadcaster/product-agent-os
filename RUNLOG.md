# RUNLOG.md

<!-- product-agent-os:start runlog -->
Project: Codex Docs / Product-Agent OS
Last compacted: 2026-06-11

## Purpose

`RUNLOG.md` is now the compact handoff layer. It records current-cycle decisions, latest evidence summaries, residual risks and routing pointers. Detailed historical ledgers and batch marker banks belong in source-owned backlog files, `prod_test.md` and registry entries.

## Latest Handoff Summary

- track10_task26_batch35_closed_through_m41_owner_closed_no_op_git_release_pr_b38_s2_m05_cache_refresh_completed_b38_s3_m09_design_only_no_real_project_execution_b38_s4_m11_safety_rollback_gap_recorded.
- Task 26 Batch 35 `T10-LIVE-M41` closed as `owner_closed_no_op_git_release_pr`; `blocked_pending_explicit_cache_mutation_approval` is preserved as historical evidence; `done_through_m40`.
- Root control-plane hygiene was audited in response to system-file review. Recommended remediation: compact `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TEST.md` and `RUNLOG.md`; remove mojibake from `REQUIREMENTS.md`; remove UTF-8 BOM from `TEST.md`; move historical density to source-owned artifacts.
- `rg` is installed and available as `ripgrep 14.1.0`; future searches should prefer `rg`/`rg --files` before PowerShell fallbacks.
- Current unrelated dirty work observed before this cleanup must be preserved and not reverted:
  - `.product-agent-os-status-current/.codex/product-agent-os/status.html` deleted;
  - `.product-agent-os-status-current/.codex/product-agent-os/status.json` deleted;
  - `.product-agent-os-status-current/product-agent-os-stage-manifest.json` deleted;
  - `.understand-anything/.understandignore` deleted.

## Current Product-Agent OS State

| Workstream | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Track 9 / Track 10 history | Source-owned historical context. | Use detailed backlogs and registry for historical claims. |
| Task 26 Batch 35 | Closed through `T10-LIVE-M41` as `owner_closed_no_op_git_release_pr`. | No branch, stage, commit, push or PR was performed; future git writes require fresh preflight and exact approval. |
| Batch 38 S1/S2/S3/S4 | Recorded as implemented/reviewed according to source-owned history. | `B38-S2` includes `plugin_cache_refresh_final_status: completed_local_cache_refresh_from_prepared_stage`; historical `blocked_pending_explicit_cache_mutation_approval` is preserved. |
| `B38-PILOT-NF01` | Docs-only target pilot addendum completed. | Target apply remains blocked by `source_policy_status: blocked` and missing target control-plane/source registry artifacts. |
| Batch 39 | Planned as `B39-TEST-M01..M54` across `B39-S1..B39-S5`. | Execution must start in `prod_test.md`; selecting a project is required once a task needs real target evidence or mutation. |
| Batch 40 completion-skeptic | Closed as local manual foundation through `B40-S5`. | Promotion state remains `manual_only` and `not_promoted`. |

## Control-Plane Marker Bank

Distribution map: `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TEST.md`, `EVALS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/sources/registry.md`, `docs/sources/product-agent-os-track-8-detailed-backlog.md`, `docs/sources/product-agent-os-track-9-backlog.md`, `docs/sources/product-agent-os-track-10-backlog.md`, `docs/sources/product-agent-os-batch35-approval-packet-draft.md`.

## Preserved Historical Markers

These markers are retained as compact discovery anchors, not as full evidence:

- B37 planning/hygiene markers: `T10-PLAN-M01..M03`, `T10-PLAN-M04..M05`, `T10-PLAN-M06`, `T10-PLAN-M07..M09`, `task_matrix_system_file_hygiene_owner_present`.
- Batch 35 live marker: `T10-LIVE-M41`, `owner_closed_no_op_git_release_pr`.
- Batch 38 markers: `B38-S1`, `B38-S2`, `B38-S3`, `B38-S4`, `B38-PILOT-NF01`, `blocked_pending_explicit_cache_mutation_approval`, `blocked_sandbox_cache_write_denied_after_backup_stage`.
- Batch 39 markers: `B39-S1`, `B39-S2`, `B39-S3`, `B39-S4`, `B39-S5`, `B39-TEST-M01..M54`.
- Batch 40 markers: `B40-S2`, `B40-S3`, `B40-S4`, `B40-S5`, `B40-DVL-M22`, `B40-DVL-M23`, `B40-DVL-M24`, `completion_skeptic_manual_pilot_ledger`, `completion_skeptic_go_no_go_closure`, `implemented_pilot_metrics_closure_manual_only`, `manual_only`, `not_promoted`.
- Product-Agent OS Track 10 Task 26 Batch 35 approval-bound real testing execution matrix.
- `done_through_m40` is historical status context, not permission for new execution.

## Current Batch 39 Handoff

- Next active route: prepare Batch 39 slice 1 in `prod_test.md`.
- Owner action: choose or approve the target boundary before any test needing real target evidence, target runtime behavior or mutation.
- Codex action: map the selected `B39-TEST-*` tasks into attempt entries with technical/product objective, owner/Codex action split, prerequisites, evidence, result, failure/fix/retest and residual risk.
- Approval boundary: no target write, browser automation, provider call, live server, canonical mutation, git write or external action without exact approval.

## Verification Runbook

For docs/control-plane edits, run:

```powershell
python -m unittest tests.product_agent_os.test_product_agent_os_docs -v
python tools\check_docs.py
git diff --check
```

Strict MkDocs is required only when navigation, Mermaid diagrams, Markdown extensions, MkDocs config, localized nav, search/sitemap behavior or generated `site/` evidence changes.

## Residual Risks

- Batch 39 has not been executed until `prod_test.md` contains actual attempt evidence.
- `B38-PILOT-NF01` target apply remains blocked by source-policy and target-artifact gaps.
- Batch 40 completion-skeptic automation is still `manual_only` and `not_promoted`.
- Historical detail has been intentionally moved out of root control-plane files; future broad historical claims should cite the source backlogs or registry.
